<h1> You took the flooded path </h1>

<p> Now your shoes are soaked... and no one likes that! <br>

	You can now take a break at the picnic tables near by or head back to the car because you wet shoes have made the hike unbareble.
<br>

One side of the fork is flooded but the path markers are clearer <br>

The other side of the fork has less water but you're not sure if you can see the train markers
